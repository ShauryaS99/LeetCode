Didn't really solve this in an algorithmic way. Luckily in python there was very simple syntax to sort a list of strings (which will sort it lexicographically). All I had to do was transform the list of int to a list of strings. 

Anyways, consistency is key. Sorting lists is a valuable skill and being aware of that syntax will come in handy later on.
